    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This aromatic fried rice uses thai basil to bring life to last nights leftovers! Its best to use leftover rice but you can customize this dish to your hearts content with any protein or veggies that you like.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Fried Rice</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups cooked and cooled rice leftover is best</li>
        <li>Neutral oil for cooking</li>
        <li>1/2 onion sliced or diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup fresh basil I used a mix of Thai and holy basil</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 long green chili optional for heat</li>
        <li>1 small tomato diced</li>
        <li>Feel free to use any other protein and vegetables of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Seasoning</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 tbsp vegetarian oyster sauce or stir-fry sauce</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp soy sauce to taste</li>
        <li>2 tsp dark soy sauce optional for colour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Break apart your rice. I used leftover medium grain rice from the previous night.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan or wok with some oil. Saute the onion and then add in the garlic.</li>
        <li>Add vegetables and protein of choice and cook until tender. Add half of the basil and you can break this apart with your hands.</li>
        <li>I add the tomato last because I want to retain the chunks and not overcook the tomato.</li>
        <li>Add the leftover rice. Season your rice. Mix well and feel free to add more of the seasonings if needed.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the basil and mix into the rice until wilted.</li>
        <li>Serve the rice and enjoy while hot. I like to stuff my rice into a bowl and then flip it over on a plate to create a dome shape.</li>
    </ol>
